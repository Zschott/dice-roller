# dice-roller

This came about after a work party that involved rolling 2d6 as part of a game, but there weren't any dice to be found. Immediately starting thinking how it would be coded, and eventually came up with this. Ideally, I'd eventually like to add a timer to the rolling button with some styled animation, so a hypothetical user couldn't just spam the button.
